# Appium Calculator Automation

## Overview

This repository contains an example Appium automation script written in Java that demonstrates the use of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts to automate interactions with the Calculator app on an Android device or emulator.

### Features

- Encapsulation: Private fields and methods within classes.
- Inheritance: A base class for page objects and specialized classes.
- Abstraction: Abstract class for the base page.
- Polymorphism: Method overriding for different mathematical operations.

## Prerequisites

Before you can run the automation script, make sure you have the following prerequisites set up:

1. **Appium Server**: Install and run Appium Server. You can download it from the official website: [Appium](http://appium.io/)

2. **Android Emulator or Device**: Ensure you have an Android emulator or a physical Android device connected to your computer.

3. **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Install JDK on your computer if you haven't already.

4. **Appium Java Client**: Include the Appium Java client library in your Java project. You can add it as a Maven or Gradle dependency in your project's `pom.xml` or `build.gradle` file.

5. **Calculator APK**: Download the APK of the Calculator app or replace it with the APK of the app you want to automate.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/AppiumCalculatorAutomation.git
   ```

2. Open the project in your preferred Integrated Development Environment (IDE), such as Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA.

3. Ensure that your Appium Server is running, and your Android emulator or device is connected and accessible.

4. Modify the following values in the `CalculatorAutomation.java` file to match your setup:
   - Device name: Replace `"emulator-5554"` with your device name.
   - App path: Replace `"path_to_calculator_apk.apk"` with the path to your APK.

5. Run the `CalculatorAutomation.java` file as a Java application. This will execute the automation script, showcasing OOP concepts.

6. View the console output for the results of addition and subtraction operations.

## Directory Structure

- `CalculatorAutomation.java`: The main script file that automates interactions with the Calculator app.
- `BasePage.java`: An abstract base class for encapsulating common functionality and the driver instance.
- `CalculatorPage.java`: A page object class for the Calculator app, demonstrating OOP concepts.
- `pom.xml`: The Maven project configuration file containing dependencies.
